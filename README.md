## About the Project
Formula 1 race outcomes can be heavily influenced by strategic decisions made regarding pit stops and weather conditions. This project is in progress and focuses on identifying correlations between these factors and their effect on race positions and performance. 

## Objectives
- Investigate how **pit stop timing** and **frequency** impact race positions.
- Explore the influence of **weather conditions** on race outcomes.
- Analyze the combined effect of pit stops and weather on driver performance.

## Approach
1. **Data Sources**:
   - **Ergast API**: Provides comprehensive Formula 1 race data, including race results, pit stop details, and driver information.
   - **OpenWeather API**: Supplies historical weather data to understand weather conditions during each race event.

2. **Data Pipeline**:
   - **Data Ingestion**: Extract raw data from Ergast and OpenWeather APIs.
   - **Data Storage**: Store raw data in AWS S3 (Bronze layer) for initial processing.
   - **Data Transformation**:
     - **Silver Layer**: Clean and transform data for structured analysis.
     - **Gold Layer**: Create a refined dataset optimized for analysis and visualization.
   
3. **Analysis**:
   - Track correlations between pit stops, weather data, and race outcomes.
   - Identify patterns in pit stop timing and frequency and how they influence race results under different weather conditions.
